# MIPS Processor

I created this project back in Spring 2017 as a semester-long project for my computer organization class. Here is the link to my lab's page

This 16-bit processor was created with the Verilog Hardware Description Languge (VHDL), is fully-functioning and pipelined. This system takes in basic instructions in the form of machine code in order to perform basic operations. The 16-bit operations are: 
* addition
* subtraction
* bitwise AND
* bitwise OR
* set less than

The calculations are then output to a file in binary.
